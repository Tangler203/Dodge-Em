# Dodge-Em
## Project for Graphics Programming

This is a game called Dodge 'Em. You are a blue square and the goal is to dodge red circles for as long as possible.

## Instructions
Use the arrow keys to move the square left and right. At the start screen press space to start and at the end screen press space to return to the start screen.
When a ball reaches the bottom of the screen you gain a point. After 20 points, every 5th point increases the ball speed and rate of spawn, increasing difficulty.
Also after 20 points, there is a small chance (5%) that a green ball will spawn. Touching this ball grants you a point and reduces the ball speed and rate of spawn.
